# Project RazorPagesMovie

Small film project where you can create, update, edit and delete the film in the database table in an API.

This set of tasks is called CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

No command was entered or a table was created. Everything was done automatically through the Entity Framework.

The database used was Microsoft SQL from Visual Studio itself, which is Community 2002. .Net Core 7.0 was used.
